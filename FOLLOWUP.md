## Follow-up Questions
1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
About 7 hours Backend API. I spent too long on user creating and Authorisation.
Spent about 10 hours on the ReactJS frontend.

2. Which parts were the most challenging? Trying to learn ReactJS in a weekend is quite challening.  I learned enough to complete some of the tasks.

3. What would you add to your solution if you had time? 
Make the ReactJS front end UI more user freindly.
Add better detection of whether a user is logged in / not logged in on the React frontend.

What further improvements or features would you add?
4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? 
The Development Tools in Chrome browser provide some analysis. But for backend performance, PHPUnit would be a useful tool. 

Have you ever had to do this? I've only done the exercises in the the PHPUnit course onLinkedIn learning. Never on a real project.
