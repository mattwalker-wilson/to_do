## Follow-up Questions
1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

<p>About 5 hours Backend API. I spent too long on user Authorisation and Authentication, which wasn't asked for in the task.</p>
<p>Spent about 10 hours on the ReactJS frontend.</p>

2. Which parts were the most challenging? 

<p>Trying to learn ReactJS in a weekend is quite challening.  I learned enough to complete the tasks.</p>

3. What would you add to your solution if you had time? 

<p>Make the ReactJS front end UI more user friendly and more of a Single Page Application. For example, updating the names of Lists should be done in-place, on the same page as the list of Lists.</p>

<p>All the CRUD functions are protected with user logon.  Wwhen the Token expires, there is no checking to see if the user is logged on or not.  Visiting a bookmarked page, without loggin on, causes a error.</p>

What further improvements or features would you add?
<p>Re-ordeing of To Do items on the list.  The To Do Items are displayed in the order they are created. Having a drag-and-drop re-ordeing would be welcome. The order could signify priority of tasks.</p>
<p>The only editable attribute of a List Item is "Completed" which is true/false. A scale of completion e.g. 10% complete, 25% complete would be useful</p>. 
<p>The only changes that happen in-place on the ShowALl page are deletel a list itme or delete a list or change the "Completed" status of a list Item.  The other changes - chaninging the List name, creating a new List and adding a new List Item, should all happen on the one page, without navigating away to different pages.</p>

4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? 

<p>The Development Tools in Chrome browser provide some analysis. But for backend performance, PHPUnit would be a useful tool. </p>

Have you ever had to do this? 

<p>I've only done the exercises in the the PHPUnit course onLinkedIn learning. Never on a real project.</p>
